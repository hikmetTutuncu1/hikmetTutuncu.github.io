                    Abacus is the first known calculating machine
                    used for counting, invented in Mesopotamia. It is a
                    hand operated calculator. It is made of beads and rods
                    that can be slide up and down. It is mostly used for
                    addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. We
                    first started making machines to help us counting and
                    help us to remember the answers to the Math
                    problems.<br><br>

            Many historians place the origin of the modern computer with Charles Babbage, he
            created the mechanical engine in 1860’s, many historians call it mechanical calculator. It
            made of gears, levers and rods. It could be add, subtract etc. but it was not a computer.
            Charles Babbage called “Father of computer”. Babbage Machine called automatic electrical
            tabulating machine, it was used by US Census Bureau in 1890.<br><br><br>

        <b><font color="red" size="6"><b>GEORGE BOOLE</b></font></h2> <br><br>
        <p>George Boole was a Mathematician, he invented the Boolean Logic. We can say that
        “0” and “1” of computer. Many historians accept that George Boole is father of computer
        science. All the computers and electronical systems include binary system of ones and zeros.
        George Boole invented that. The logic called “Boolean Algebra”. For example, if we search
        on a word with Google, the Boolean Algebra works background with search engine.</p><br><br>
        <b><font color="red" size="6"><b>ENIAC</b></font></h2> <br><br>
        John Mauchly and others completed the
        ENIAC(Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer)
        in Pennsylvania University in 1946. ENIAC was 1000
        times faster than previous machines. It has 18.000
        electronical tubes, 150 kW power; and it was 50 tons ,
        167 m2. It could 5.000 addition per second. It created to
        calculate speed of the bullets so it was created for
        military. With ENIAC, started transition to electronical
        computer.<br><br>
        <b><font color="red" size="6"><b>UNIVAC</b></font></h2> <br><br>
        UNIVAC(Universal Automatic Computer)
        created by creators who developed ENIAC in 1951.
        It used from United States of America Census
        Bureau. The UNIVAC was the first commercial
        computer. It sold to General Electric in 1954, so it
        was the first computer in business world. UNIVAC
        used magnetic tapes for input-outputs, the computer
        was the first this area, too.<br><br>
